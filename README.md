This project is a vision-based AI system that allows users to solve mathematical problems by simply drawing them in the air using hand gestures. By combining real-time hand tracking via computer vision with the problem-solving capabilities of Google's Gemini generative AI, users can write equations mid-air using their index finger. The system recognizes the gesture-based input, converts it into a digital expression, and instantly provides the solutionâ€”offering a touchless, intuitive interface for interacting with mathematical content.

ðŸš€ Key Features
Real-time webcam-based hand tracking using cvzone and OpenCV

Gesture recognition for drawing, clearing, and submitting equations

Seamless integration with Google Gemini AI to interpret and solve math problems

Interactive UI built with Streamlit for live feedback and user control

A futuristic, educational, and accessible approach to human-computer interaction

NOTE: use your own image for png or jpeg format 
Also, keep in mind about your video capture. Some machines use 0 as default camera and some uses 1
e.g, cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) ## here in my case its 0
