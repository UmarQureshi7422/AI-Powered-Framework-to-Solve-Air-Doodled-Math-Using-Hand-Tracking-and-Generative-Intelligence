This project is a vision-based AI system that allows users to solve mathematical problems by simply drawing them in the air using hand gestures. By combining real-time hand tracking via computer vision with the problem-solving capabilities of Google's Gemini generative AI, users can write equations mid-air using their index finger. The system recognizes the gesture-based input, converts it into a digital expression, and instantly provides the solutionâ€”offering a touchless, intuitive interface for interacting with mathematical content.
